						    	<p class="about-paragraph">Hello, I'm Jessica. I'm a software engineer with an eye for design and a passion for creating great experiences with code. My innate curiosity extends into my web development career and as a result, I enjoy learning new practices and technologies.</p>
						    	<p class="about-paragraph">At heart, I am a self-starter that believes in learning by doing. I demonstrate this by creating personal projects in addition to delivering client-initiated work. Iâ€™ve had the honor of collaborating with producers, designers, animators, QA analysts, and fellow engineers to deliver engaging websites. In addition to technical ability, I also possess the intangible qualities of having an eye for detail, the ability to learn quickly as well as being adaptable and resourceful.</p>
						    	<p class="about-paragraph">I look forward to facing the unique challenges that each project presents as they are opportunities for further professional growth. I am eager to bring both my technical skills and personal attributes to an organization where I can contribute to solving problems efficiently and help create experiences that users ultimately enjoy.</p>
