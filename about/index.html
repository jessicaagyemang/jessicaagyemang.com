						    	<p class="about-paragraph">I am a front-end developer with an eye for design and a passion for writing clean, readable, and reusable code. I have an endless curiosity that drives me to learn and explore new things. This curiosity extends into my web development career and as a result, I enjoy learning about the latest practices and technologies in this rapidly changing industry.</p>
						    	<p class="about-paragraph">Iâ€™ve had the honor of collaborating with producers, designers, animators, QA analysts, and fellow developers to deliver engaging, interactive websites using an ever-growing skill set that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I look forward to facing the unique challenges that each project presents as they are opportunities for further professional growth.</p>
						    	<p class="about-paragraph">At heart, I am a self-starter that believes in learning by doing. This is demonstrated by various personal projects and learning experiments published alongside client work. In addition to technical ability, I also possess the intangible qualities of having an eye for detail and a quick learning ability on top of being adaptable, resourceful, and proactive in approach to tasks and communication. I am eager to bring both my technical skills and personal qualities to an organization where I can contribute to solving problems efficiently and helping create experiences that users ultimately love.</p>
